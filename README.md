# IoT Power Monitoring System

This repository contains the firmware code for an IoT-based power monitoring system. The system is designed to monitor various parameters such as grid power, inverter power, home power consumption, and more.

## Overview

The firmware is designed to run on an ESP32 microcontroller board. It communicates with energy monitoring modules to collect real-time data and sends this data to a Firebase Realtime Database for storage and analysis. Additionally, the firmware includes functionalities such as WiFi reconnection, handling button presses, and firmware updates.

## Features

- Monitoring of grid power, inverter power, and home power consumption
- Automatic WiFi reconnection
- Handling long button presses to switch to a hotspot mode
- Firmware update functionality through HTTP updates

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/iot-power-monitoring.git
    ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Arduino IDE.

3. Connect your ESP32 board to your computer and upload the firmware.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the ESP32 board is connected to the energy monitoring modules and the WiFi network.

2. The firmware will automatically start monitoring and sending data to the Firebase Realtime Database.

3. To switch to hotspot mode, press and hold the button for a long press duration. This will disconnect from the current WiFi network and start a hotspot for configuration.

4. Check for firmware updates by monitoring the Firebase Realtime Database. If an update is available, the firmware will automatically download and install it.

## Configuration

Before uploading the firmware, ensure that you have configured the following parameters:

- WiFi credentials (`esid` and `epass`) for connecting to the WiFi network.
- Firebase Realtime Database credentials (`API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `eemail`, and `eupass`) for data storage and retrieval.
